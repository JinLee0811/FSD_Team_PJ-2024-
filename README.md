# University Interactive System: CLIUniApp & GUIUniApp

Welcome to the University Interactive System repository, featuring both command-line (CLIUniApp) and graphical user interface (GUIUniApp) components designed to manage student and administrative operations for a local university. This Python-based system allows students to register, log in, enroll in subjects, and more, while admins can manage student records and view performance data.

## Features

### CLIUniApp
- **Student Registration and Login:** Allows students to register and log into the system using their credentials.
- **Subject Enrollment:** Registered students can enroll in up to four subjects.
- **Password Management:** Enables students to change their passwords.
- **Admin Features:** Admins can manage student details, categorize students by grades, and clear student records.

### GUIUniApp
- **Student Login Interface:** Provides a user-friendly GUI for student login.
- **Enrollment Management:** Allows students to manage their enrolled subjects through a GUI.
- **Data Integrity:** Manages and stores all student and subject data securely using `students.data`.
